CHAPTER 3.1
Defining and Using Lambdas

Sometimes we want to group some lines of code so that they can be reused, but creating a named function feels unnecessary. In these situations, such as when we're acting on the items of a collection, we can use lambdas or "lambda expressions" to create anonymous functions. In this lesson, we'll learn how to create and use lambdas.

What Is an Anonymous Function?
An anonymous function refers to a function that doesn't have a name. If we try to classify what makes a function, we can break it into a few requirements:

A name
A list of parameters
A function body
An optional return value


The name portion is only a requirement so that we can reference it later. But if we want a "function" that isn't useful anywhere else besides the current context, we can define a function without a name by using the lambda keyword to create a "lambda expression". We could still assign it to a variable if we want. There is one catch: the lambda's body can only be one expression.


Creating a Lambda

To learn more about lambdas, let's create a folder called lambdas-and-collections. Within it, let's create a new file called learning_lambdas.py.

$ mkdir ~/lambdas-and-collections
$ cd ~/lambdas-and-collections


The easiest way to wrap our minds around lambdas is to convert an existing function into one. Let's convert the following square function to be a lambda:

~/lambdas-and-collections/learning_lambdas.py

def square(num):
    return num * num


Lambdas are most commonly used for single-line functions like this, and the last expression in the lambda is always returned. With that in mind, this function could be written as a lambda like this:

~/lambdas-and-collections/learning_lambdas.py

def square(num):
    return num * num

square_lambda = lambda num : num * num



To call our lambda, we use parenthesis the same way we do when calling a function. Let's ensure that this function and lambda are equivalent by adding an assert statement to the end of the file before running the file:

~/lambdas-and-collections/learning_lambdas.py

def square(num):
    return num * num

square_lambda = lambda num : num * num

assert square(3) == square_lambda(3)
If we run this file, we should see that there are no errors:

$ cd ~/lambdas-and-collections
$ python3.7 learning_lambdas.py
$


Now that we know how to define and call lambda expressions, we're ready to learn about when we're most likely to put them to use: when using collection functions.
