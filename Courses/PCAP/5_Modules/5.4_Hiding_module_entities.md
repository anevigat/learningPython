CHAPTER 5.4
Hiding Module Entities

Now that we know how to import our modules, we might want to restrict what is exposed. In this lesson, we'll look at how we can hide some of our module's contents from being imported by other modules and scripts.

What Are Module Entities?

When we see module entities, we need to see variables, functions, and classes (we'll cover classes in the next section). A module entity is anything we provide with a name in our module. As we've seen, these things are importable by name when we used from <module> import <name>.


Using __all__

If we want to prevent someone from importing an entity from our module, there aren't very many options. There are only two reasonable things we can do to restrict what is imported if someone uses from <module> import *. The first is by setting the __all__ variable in our module. Let's test this out by setting __all__ to a list including only extract_upper to see what happens in main.py.

~/using_modules/helpers.py

__all__ = ["extract_upper"]

def extract_upper(phrase):
    return list(filter(str.isupper, phrase))

def extract_lower(phrase):
    return list(filter(str.islower, phrase))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("HELLO FROM HELPERS")


In main.py, we had been using both of these functions after loading them with from helpers import *. Here's another look at what main.py currently looks like.

~/using_modules/main.py

from helpers import *
import extras

print(f"Lowercase letters: {extract_lower(extras.name)}")
print(f"Uppercase letters: {extract_upper(extras.name)}")


With __all__ set in helpers, let's run main.py to see what happens.

$ python3.7 main.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "main.py", line 4, in <module>
    print(f"Lowercase letters: {extract_lower(extras.name)}")
NameError: name 'extract_lower' is not defined


Although name exists within helpers.py, it is not available in other modules via from helpers import *. This does not mean that we can't explicitly import extract_lower though. Let's modify main.py to import extract_lower by name.

~/using_modules/main.py

from helpers import *
from helpers import extract_lower
import extras

print(f"Lowercase letters: {extract_lower(extras.name)}")
print(f"Uppercase letters: {extract_upper(extras.name)}")


Let's run this one more time.

$ python3.7 main.py
Lowercase letters: ['e', 'i', 't', 'h', 'h', 'o', 'm', 'p', 's', 'o', 'n']
Uppercase letters: ['K', 'T']


While it doesn't allow us to prevent an entity from ever being imported, using __all__ does provide a way of sometimes restricting what is imported by modules and scripts consuming our modules and packages.



Using Underscored Entities

The other way we can prevent an entity from being exported automatically when someone uses from <module> import * is by making the first character an underscore (_). If we removed __all__ from helpers.py and created a variable called _hidden_var = "test", we would not have access to _hidden_var after running from helpers import *.
