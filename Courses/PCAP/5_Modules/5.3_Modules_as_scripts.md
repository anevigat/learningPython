CHAPTER 5.3
Executing Modules as Scripts

Python modules are just files, but sometimes we want them to behave slightly differently if they're being run directly. In this lesson, we'll learn about how modules are interpreted when imported and also how to only run code when a module is run directly by using the __name__ variable.

Expressions in a Module

Since modules are just Python files, they can contain expressions and the file will be interpreted from top to bottom. So a few good questions to ask ourselves are:

When is a module interpreted?
Can a module be interpreted twice?


To test this, let's create another module that imports our helpers module and also import that new module into our main.py. We'll call this module extras.py.

~/using_modules/extras.py

print("Importing 'helpers' in 'extras'")
import helpers

name = "Keith Thompson"


In main.py, let's import extras.

~/using_modules/main.py

print("We're importing 'helpers' from 'main'")
from helpers import *

print("We're importing 'extras' from 'main'")
import extras

print(f"Lowercase letters: {extract_lower(extras.name)}")
print(f"Uppercase letters: {extract_upper(extras.name)}")


Finally, in helpers.py we'll add print, so that we can see when it is run and how many times it is run.

~/using_modules/helpers.py

def extract_upper(phrase):
    return list(filter(str.isupper, phrase))

def extract_lower(phrase):
    return list(filter(str.islower, phrase))

print("HELLO FROM HELPERS")


We now have enough print lines to helps us really see how main.py is processed and when our modules are interpreted. When we run it, this is what we see:

$ python3.7 main.py
We're importing 'helpers' from 'main'
HELLO FROM HELPERS
We're importing 'extras' from 'main'
We're import 'helpers' from 'extras'
Lowercase letters: ['e', 'i', 't', 'h', 'h', 'o', 'm', 'p', 's', 'o', 'n']
Uppercase letters: ['K', 'T']


As we can see, the code within the helpers module was only interpreted the first time that it was imported. So even though it was imported into two different modules, it was only ever run one time.

Running a Module Directly

Ideally, we don't want to run this print line when our module is imported, but sometimes we do want a module to execute something if it is run directly. To handle this, we can access the __name__ variable. The __name__ variable is set in each module and can be used to determine if the module is being run directly as opposed to being imported. Let's change the various print lines from our previous lesson to help us understand the values set to __name__ in each of our scripts.

~/using_modules/main.py

from helpers import *
import extras

print(f"__name__ in main.py: {__name__}")

print(f"Lowercase letters: {extract_lower(extras.name)}")
print(f"Uppercase letters: {extract_upper(extras.name)}")

~/using_modules/helpers.py

def extract_upper(phrase):
    return list(filter(str.isupper, phrase))

def extract_lower(phrase):
    return list(filter(str.islower, phrase))

print(f"__name__ in helpers.py: {__name__}")
print("HELLO FROM HELPERS")

~/using_modules/extras.py

import helpers

print(f"__name__ in extras.py: {__name__}")

name = "Keith Thompson"


Here's what we see when we run main.py:

$ python3.7 main.py
__name__ in helpers.py: helpers
HELLO FROM HELPERS
__name__ in extras.py: extras
__name__ in main.py: __main__
Lowercase letters: ['e', 'i', 't', 'h', 'h', 'o', 'm', 'p', 's', 'o', 'n']
Uppercase letters: ['K', 'T']


All of the modules that we imported have __name__ set to the actual module name, but main.py is set to __main__ because it is running in the main context. A common pattern is to add a condition like this if we want to add functionality to a module only if it is running in the main context:

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Something only when running in main scope")


To demonstrate this, let's remove all of these debugging lines, but move "HELLO FROM HELPERS" into this conditional in helpers.py.

(We're only showing the change to helpers.py, but we removed all of the '__name__ in ...' output)

~/using_modules/helpers.py

def extract_upper(phrase):
    return list(filter(str.isupper, phrase))

def extract_lower(phrase):
    return list(filter(str.islower, phrase))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("HELLO FROM HELPERS")


If we now run main.py we should see the following:

$ python3.7 main.py
Lowercase letters: ['e', 'i', 't', 'h', 'h', 'o', 'm', 'p', 's', 'o', 'n']
Uppercase letters: ['K', 'T']


If we run helpers.py directly, we should see the print line being run.

$ python3.7 helpers.py
HELLO FROM HELPERS
