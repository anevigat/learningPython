CHAPTER 6.2
Creating and Using Python Classes

The next step in our programming journey requires us to think about how we can model concepts from our problem. To do that, we'll often use classes to create completely new data types. In this lesson, we'll create our very first class and learn how to work with its data and functionality.

Defining New Types

Up to this point, we've been working with the built-in types that Python provides (e.g. str, int, float), but when we're modeling problems in our programs we often want more complex objects that fit our specific problem's domain. For instance, if we were writing a program to model information about vehicles for an automotive shop, then it would make sense for us to have an object type that represents a vehicle. This is where we will start working with classes.

From this point on, most of the code that we'll be writing will be in files. Let's create a python_objects directory to hold these files that are only there to facilitate learning.

$ mkdir ~/python_objects
$ cd ~/python_objects


Creating Our First Class

For this lesson, we'll use a file called vehicle.py. Our goal is to model a vehicle that has tires and an engine. To create a class we use the class keyword, followed by a name for the class, starting with a capital letter. Let's create our first class, the Vehicle class:

~/python_objects/vehicle.py

class Vehicle:
    """
    Docstring describing the class
    """

    def __init__(self):
        """
        Docstring describing the method
        """
        pass


This is an incredibly simple class. A few things to note here are that by adding a triple-quoted string right under the definition of the class, and also right under the definition of a method or function, we can add documentation. This documentation is nice because we can add examples in this string to run as tests to help ensure our documentation stays up-to-date with the implementation.

A method is a function defined within the context of an object, and Python classes can define special functions that start with double underscores __, such as the __init__ method. This method is the initializer for our class, and it is where we customize what happens when a new instance is being created. In practice, this method will usually just set attributes on the instance. The initializer is what is used when we create a new version of our class by running code like this:

>>> my_vehicle = Vehicle()


We would like our Vehicle class to hold a few pieces of data such as the tires and an engine. For the time being, we're going to have those be a list containing a string for the tires and a string for the engine. Let's modify our __init__ method to have the engine and tires parameters:

~/python_objects/vehicle.py

class Vehicle:
    """
    Vehicle models a vehicle w/ tires and an engine
    """

    def __init__(self, engine, tires):
        self.engine = engine
        self.tires = tires


What Is self?

A big change from writing functions to writing methods is the presence of self. This variable references the individual instance of the class that we're working with. The Vehicle class holds onto the information about vehicles within our program, where an instance of the Vehicle class could represent a specific vehicle like my Honda Civic. Let's load our class into the REPL using python3.7 -i vehicle.py, and then create a specific instance of my Honda Civic.

$ python3.7 -i vehicle.py
>>> civic = Vehicle('4-cylinder', ['front-driver', 'front-passenger', 'rear-driver', 'rear-passenger'])
>>> civic.tires
['front-driver', 'front-passenger', 'rear-driver', 'rear-passenger']
>>> civic.engine
'4-cylinder'


Once we have our instance, we can access our internal attributes by using a period (.). Attributes are variables attached to the instance. Our civic variable has an engine attribute, which just means that engine is one of its internal variables.


Defining a Custom Method

The last thing that we'll do to round out the first rendition of our class is to define a method that prints a description of the vehicle to the screen.

~/python_objects/vehicle.py

class Vehicle:
    """
    Vehicle models a vehicle w/ tires and an engine
    """

    def __init__(self, engine, tires):
        self.engine = engine
        self.tires = tires

    def description(self):
        print(f"A vehicle with an {self.engine} engine, and {self.tires} tires")


Our description method doesn't have any actual arguments, but we pass the instance in as self. From there, we can access the instance's attributes by calling self.attribute_name.

Let's use this new method:

$ python3.7 -i vehicle.py
>>> civic = Vehicle('4-cylinder', ['front-driver', 'front-passenger', 'rear-driver', 'rear-passenger'])
>>> civic.engine
'4-cylinder'
>>> civic.tires
['front-driver', 'front-passenger', 'rear-driver', 'rear-passenger']
>>> civic.description
<bound method Vehicle.description of <__main__.Vehicle object at 0x7fb5f3fbbda0>>
>>> civic.description()
A vehicle with a 4-cylinder engine, and ['front-driver', 'front-passenger', 'rear-driver', 'rear-passenger'] tires


Just like a normal function, if we don't use parenthesis, the method won't execute.


Adding and Removing Attributes from Instances

We've seen how to define attributes as part of our instance initialization code, but an instance of a custom class also acts as a namespace for any attribute we want. This means that after we create an instance of a custom class, we can add attributes to it in the same way we assign a new variable. We just need to chain the attribute off of our instance's identifier. Let's add a serial_number (attribute) to my civic (identifier).

>>> civic.serial_number = '1234'
>>> civic.serial_number
'1234'


We can remove attributes from an instance of a class using the del keyword, just like we would to delete a variable. Remember, we need to be accessing the attribute and not just pass in our object.

>>> del civic.serial_number
>>> civic.serial_number
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
AttributeError: 'Vehicle' object has no attribute 'serial_number'
