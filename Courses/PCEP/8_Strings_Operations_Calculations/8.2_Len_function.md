CHAPTER 8.2
The `len` Function

In this short lesson, we're going to take a look at a built-in function that will help us see how long any sequence or collection type is, including strings: the len function.

The len Function
Needing to know the length of a string is very common. Thankfully, the len function will return how many characters are in a string:

>>> len('testing')
7
>>> len('')
0

This may seem a little boring, but it will help us to keep from causing too many errors when we start learning about indexing and slicing in the next lesson.
